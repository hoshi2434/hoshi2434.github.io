Dev notes: Most likely discontinued. Too many broken codes and missing route data. If I have the time, I will occasionally fix them.

State: UNDER TESTING. Most data incorrect and/or broken. IF YOU ARE GIVEN THIS LINK, DO NOT LEAK.

Version 06112020:

>Try not to use this anymore. Instead, use the more reliable EDS Simulator, tinyurl.com/richtigsauerapps If there is a demand for a web version, I'll continue updating code. Maybe a collab with RichtigSauer soon? (I doubt but ok)
